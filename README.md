# AI-Hackathon

This code was written for an AI hackathon conducted in the college where students pursuing any degree (B.Tech, M.Tech or Ph.D) were allowed to participate. There were totally 17 teams who registered. A team could consist of 2-4 members. Our team consisted of 3 members. We won the 2nd place in the hackathon and also received a cash prize of Rs. 15,000.

### Task: 

Create a model that can accurately classify an image into its variety.

Time alloted for the hackathon: 7 days

<br>

### Dataset Info: 

The dataset contains about 65,000 labelled images of seeds of 6 different varities. Every variety/class has 10,000-12,000 samples.

<br>

### Source Code files Information: 

The `training.ipynb` file in the root directory of this repository contains the code of creating a deep learning model, training it on the given data and saving it as a `.pth` file in the same directory.

The `inference.ipynb` file contains the code to load the model and a function that accepts an image path as an argument and predicts its class (variety in this case)

<br>

### Results: 

Accuracy achieved: 96.3%
